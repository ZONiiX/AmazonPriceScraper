<h1>Amazon Price Tracker Prototype</h1>

<h2>Purpose:</h2>

The purpose of this program is to track the prices of different amazon products to inform the buyer if it is currently the best time to buy the product or not. The program will be at least 100 lines, however it will be as modular as possible as I think this project could be something that I could turn into an API in the future for future use.

  

<h2>Why:</h2>

I chose to write this program to challenge myself as I haven’t used SQL in about a year and I both wanted a refresher in SQL and wanted to make something that could benefit people’s purchasing decisions. The reason I chose amazon over any other ecommerce platform is honestly because it’s the biggest and has a massive library of items for sale.

  
<h2> Why is it all in 1 file?</h2>

This is a project I needed to make for my Principles of Computing class here at RIT. There was no other requirements other than to keep it in one file and to make it at least 100 lines. There was no main objective or actual basis as to what to base our project on, so I took it upon myself to create something that could be useful to me at another time, and at the same time make it a little bit more challenging.
